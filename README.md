# ConsoleReportCardApp_Basic
Suggested practice problem for 70-483, handles report card app using multidimensional array instead of objects


The textbook I am using suggested making use of for loops and multiD arrays instead of doing things with objects. I decided to do a x by 5 array
This array is capable of storing students and 3 grades, plus their total and a look up id.
